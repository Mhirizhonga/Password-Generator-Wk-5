# Password-Generator-Wk-5
Utilising HTML, CSS (Bootstrap) and Javascript

LINK to Deployed App: https://mhirizhonga.github.io/Password-Generator-Wk-5/

The project was built to make students utilise a number of things they'd made use of during classes including:
- Arrays
- if Statements
- Variables
- Functions
- Console.log
- Event listeners

It was tricky figuring out how to print the password to the assigned textbox but once I connected the return password function to the options if Statements, it became clearer.
